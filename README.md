X-Ways Extension to look up hashes in Virus total and identify malicious files

Home of the VirusTotal extension for X-Ways that Polito Inc. developed for use with VirusTotal.

VirusTotal hash query extension for X-Ways Forensics platform. Requires VirusTotal API credentials.
VirusTotal api credentials can be obtained here : https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
Please see our blog post for detailed instructions about how to use this VirusTotal plugin with X-Ways: https://www.politoinc.com/VirusTotal It has been tested on X-Ways versions 19.3 to 20.5 (64-bit only). Additional versions are still being tested for compatibility. 

Initial release (version 0.2). The plugin will require you to create a vtconfig.txt file in the same folder where the .DLL file is located. This should contain two fields separated by a colon ":" character. The first field should be your API key for VirusTotal and the second field should be the number of queries per minute that your API key allows. For example:

012345...abcdef:4

This will tell the X-Tension to use your API key that starts with 012345...abcdef at a rate of 4 queries per minute. Note: notepad.exe will add additional characters to text file that is incompatible with X-Ways.

We are not responsible for any issues you encounter related to use of your API key at a rate that is higher than what VirusTotal allows.

NOTE: using a rate of zero (0) tells the X-Tension to go as fast as possible (it will not rate-limit). If you have unlimited queries on VirusTotal this will get your results the fastest.
