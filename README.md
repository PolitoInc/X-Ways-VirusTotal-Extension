# X-Ways-VirusTotal-Extension
X-Ways Extension to look up hashes in Virus total and identify malicious files

Home of the VirusTotal extension for X-Ways that Polito Inc. developed for use with VirusTotal.

The use of this X-Tension will require VirusTotal API credentials.
VirusTotal API credentials can be obtained here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us

Please see our blog post for detailed instructions about how to use this VirusTotal X-Tension with X-Ways: https://www.politoinc.com/post/enhancing-digital-forensics-with-x-ways-x-tensions-virustotal-plugin 

This X-Tension has been tested on X-Ways versions 19.3 to 20.5 (64-bit only). Additional versions are still being tested for compatibility. 

The plugin will require you to create a file named vtconfig.txt in the same folder where the X-Tension .DLL file is located. This should contain two fields separated by a colon ":" character. The first field should be your API key for VirusTotal and the second field should be the number of queries per minute that your API key allows. For example:

`012345...abcdef:4`

This will tell the X-Tension to use your API key that starts with 012345...abcdef at a rate of 4 queries per minute. Note: The file needs to be saved in UTF-8 encoding; if you use UTF-16, notepad.exe will add additional characters to the text file which will cause issues when the X-Tension attempts to read the configuration file.

Polito is not responsible for any issues you encounter related to use of your API key at a rate that is higher than what VirusTotal allows.

NOTE: using a rate of zero (0) tells the X-Tension to go as fast as possible (it will not rate-limit). If you have unlimited queries on VirusTotal this will get your results the fastest.
